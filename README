darkserver
=========
This is simple python and Django based service which provides details of GNU build-ids
from various ELF files from the RPM packages. The service is divided into two
different parts.

Requirements
============

* Python >= 2.6
* Django >= 1.1.2
* elf-utils
* koji
* rpmdevtools
* mysql server


Server side command line tool
=============================

Run the createtable.sql under /usr/share/darkserver to create table structure.

Run the darkserver-import on the rpms to record build-id details of various ELF
files. You have to configure the database server details in the
/etc/darkserver/darkserver.conf file before using the above command.

Example:
$ python darkserver-import -r /tmp/attica-0.2.0-1.fc15.x86_64.rpm -d fedora-15-x86_64


Web server
==========

First setup the database details in READONLY access at /etc/darkserver/darkserverweb.conf

To start the server use the following command:

$ python manage.py runserver 8080

This will start the server at port 8080. If you want to start the server in a
different port you can provide it as a command line argument.
