darkserver
=========
This is simple python based service which provides details of GNU build-ids
from various ELF files from the RPM packages. The service is divided into two
different parts.


Server side command line tool
=============================

Run the importbuidid.py on the rpms to record build-id details of various ELF
files. You have to configure the database server details in the
/etc/darkserver.conf file before using the above command.

Example:
$ python importbuildid.py -r /tmp/attica-0.2.0-1.fc15.x86_64.rpm -d fedora-15-x86_64


Web server
==========

To start the server use the following command:

$ python server.py 8080

This will start the server at port 8080. If you want to start the server in a
different port you can provide it as a command line argument.

You can start many server instances and using a nginx server as a load
balancer in the front.
