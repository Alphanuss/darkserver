from various ELF files from the RPM packages. The service is divided into two
different parts.

Web server
==========

First setup the database details in access at /etc/darkserver/darkserverweb.conf

To start the server use the following command:

$ python manage.py runserver 8080

This will start the server at port 8080. If you want to start the server in a
different port you can provide it as a command line argument.

We are now using a fedmsg listener to listen to newer builds.
